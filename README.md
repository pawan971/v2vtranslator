# Multilingual Voice-to-Voice Translation App üéôÔ∏èüîä

## Overview

This repository hosts a open source Gradio-based application that translates your voice into multiple languages.

- **Automatic Language Detection**: Detects the language of the spoken input automatically.
- **Translation**: Translates the transcribed text into a selected target language.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the translated text back into speech, mimicking the original speaker's voice as closely as possible.
- **Language Selection**: Supports 17 languages for translation and speech synthesis.
